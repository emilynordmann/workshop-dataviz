Before the workshop it is necessary to work through some prep tasks to ensure that you are ready to go.

* If you don't currently have R or RStudio installed, please work through Chapter\ \@ref(installing-r).
* If you have R and/or RStudio installed, please skip to Section\  \@ref(rstudio-settings) and update to the latest version before the workshop.
* If you have technical issues and cannot install R and RStudio on your machine (e.g., if you don't have admin rights), please sign-up for an [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account.

Once you've done one of the above, work through Chapter\ \@ref(intro) which will introduce you to some basic programming terminology and install the packages we need for the workshop. Depending upon your familiarity with R, this should take 1-2 hours.

**Regardless of what set-up you need to do, before you join the workshop, please ensure you have completed the Workshop Set-up Check in Chapter\ \@ref(workshop-prep). If it works, you're good to go.**
