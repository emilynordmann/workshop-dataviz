### Local data files

More commonly, you will be working from data files that are stored locally on your computer. But where should you put all of your files? You usually want to have all your scripts and data files for a single project inside one folder on your computer, the <a class='glossary' target='_blank' title='The filepath where R is currently reading and writing files.' href='https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/w#working-directory'>working directory</a>, and we have already set up the main directory <code class='path'>02-reports</code>for this chapter.

But you can also organise files in subdirectories inside this main project directory, such as putting all raw data files in a directory called <code class='path'>data</code> and saving any image files to a directory called <code class='path'>images</code>. Using subdirectories helps avoid one single folder becoming too cluttered, which is important if you're working on big projects.

::: {.try data-latex=""}
In your <code class='path'>02-reports</code> directory, create a new folder named <code class='path'>data</code>, then, [download a copy of the sales data file](https://psyteachr.github.io/ads-v1/data/sales_data_sample.csv) and save it in this new subdirectory.
:::

To load in data from a local file, again we can use the `read_csv()` function but this time rather than specifying a url, give it the subdirectory and file name.


```r
sales_local <- read_csv("data/sales_data_sample.csv") 
```

Things to note:

-   You must include the file extension (in this case `.csv`)
-   The subdirectory folder name (`data`) and the file name are separated by a forward slash `/`
-   Precision is important, if you have a typo in the file name it won't be able to find your file; remember that R is case sensitive - `Sales_Data.csv` is a completely different file to `sales_data.csv` as far as R is concerned.
